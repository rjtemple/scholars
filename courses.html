                                            Foundations of data science from three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social and legal issues surrounding data analysis, including issues of privacy and data ownership.

                                            This course covers the foundational principles of linear algebra and differential equations, both of which are crucial for advanced study in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science. Topics include matrix arithmetic, determinants, and vector spaces, which form the building blocks for solving systems of linear equations. Students will explore inner product spaces, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, which are used in everything from machine learning to physics. The course also examines linear second-order differential equations and systems of first-order differential equations with constant coefficients, providing practical applications for modeling real-world phenomena. Fourier series are introduced, offering a method for analyzing periodic functions.
